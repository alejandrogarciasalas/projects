This is the second app I published in the Apple Appstore. I made this app as a personal challenge on how fast I could make an app. I finished the app in a week. The game includes simple yet challenging game mechanics. I took part in all of the game development process: game design, graphic design, level design and programming.

>"non-stop" is a real time puzzle game where the objective is to reach the green squares without hitting any walls, it may seem simple at the beginning but you will eventually see how impossible it can get! And remember we won't be _stopping_ at any time!
